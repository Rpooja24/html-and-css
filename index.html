<h1>Introduction</h1>
<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I am Pooja Ramtel(she/her). I am from Nepal and its been around 2 years since I came to USA. I have been taking few online courses since fall semester last year. It has been a completely new experience as it was my first time trying online medium. We used to have a chapter about HTML back in our school computer course but its been so long that I have already forgotten what was in it. So its like starting from ground zero. I hope I can learn new things and make a base for my career from this course. I am looking forward to learn from you. </p>
<h2>When I have free time</h2>
    <ol>
<li> I read webcomics.</li>
<li> I watch movies or motivational videos in youtube.</li>
<li> I videocall  my friends and family who are back in my country.</li>
    </ol>
